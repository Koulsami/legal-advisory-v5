# Railway Deployment Setup for v6 Conversational AI

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Enable Full Conversational AI

The v6.0 system requires the **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** environment variable to provide the full conversational AI experience.

### Current Behavior Without API Key (MOCK Mode)

When `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is **not set**, the system runs in **MOCK mode** with these limitations:

❌ **Rigid structured questions**:
```
System: "Which court is your matter in - High Court, District Court, or Magistrates Court?"
```

❌ **Limited acknowledgments**:
```
User: "what is your name"
System: "I'm MyKraws, your friendly legal advisor! Which court is your matter in..."
[Acknowledges but can't truly converse]
```

❌ **Cannot respond contextually to user questions**

### Full Experience With API Key

When `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` **is set**, the system provides:

✅ **Natural, AI-generated conversational questions**:
```
System: "Thanks for sharing that! Based on what you've told me about your High Court case,
I can see we're making good progress. To ensure I calculate the most accurate costs for you
under Order 21, could you tell me what type of judgment this was? For instance, was it..."
```

✅ **Intelligent responses to user questions**:
```
User: "what is your name"
System: "I'm MyKraws, your friendly legal neighbor! I'm here to help you understand and
calculate legal costs under Singapore's Rules of Court. What can I help you with today?"
```

✅ **Context-aware, empathetic conversation**:
```
User: "why do you need to know the court level?"
System: "Great question! The court level (High Court vs District Court vs Magistrates Court)
is one of the key factors in Order 21, Appendix 1 that determines the cost scales. The fixed
costs are different for each court level - for example, High Court costs are generally higher
than District Court costs for the same type of case. This ensures the cost award is fair and
proportionate to the court level where your matter was heard."
```

## How to Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in Railway

### Step 1: Get Your Claude API Key

1. Go to [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Navigate to **API Keys**
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

### Step 2: Add to Railway Environment Variables

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Select your **legal-advisory-v5-production** service
3. Click on the **Variables** tab
4. Click **+ New Variable**
5. Add:
   - **Name**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `sk-ant-...` (your actual API key)
6. Click **Add**
7. Railway will automatically redeploy

### Step 3: Verify It's Working

After redeployment (takes 2-3 minutes):

1. Open your Netlify frontend
2. Start a new conversation
3. You should see:
   - ✅ Natural, conversational greetings
   - ✅ AI-generated questions that acknowledge your input
   - ✅ Intelligent responses to your questions
   - ✅ Context-aware conversation flow

**Check the logs**:
- ✅ Should see: `✅ Real Claude AI enabled (API key found)`
- ✅ Should NOT see: `⚠️ No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY found - running in MOCK mode`

## Cost Considerations

The Claude API has usage-based pricing:
- **Model**: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- **Typical cost per conversation**: $0.01 - $0.05
- **Estimated monthly cost** (100 conversations/month): ~$3-5

For production use, consider:
- Setting up billing alerts in Anthropic console
- Monitoring usage via Railway logs
- Implementing rate limiting if needed

## Troubleshooting

### "Still seeing rigid questions after setting API key"

1. Verify the environment variable is set correctly in Railway
2. Check Railway logs for `✅ Real Claude AI enabled`
3. Ensure the service redeployed after adding the variable
4. Clear browser cache and start a new session

### "AI responses are slow"

- First AI call in a new session may take 3-5 seconds
- Subsequent responses should be faster (1-2 seconds)
- This is normal for Claude API calls

### "Getting API errors"

Check Railway logs for error messages:
- `401 Unauthorized`: API key is invalid
- `429 Rate Limit`: Too many requests (upgrade plan or wait)
- `500 Internal Error`: Anthropic service issue (retry)

## Architecture: Why AI is Optional

v6.0 is designed with **graceful degradation**:

```

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Legal calculation accuracy: 100% regardless of AI availability
- ✅ Validation: 100% coverage (P0 requirement) always enforced
- ⚠️ Conversational UX: Best with AI, acceptable without (fallback mode)

## Summary

|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Legal Accuracy | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% |
| Validation Coverage | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% |
| Natural Conversation | ✅ Excellent | ⚠️ Limited (fallback) |
| Acknowledges User | ✅ Contextually | ✅ Basic |
| Responds to Questions | ✅ Intelligently | ❌ Repeats same Q |
