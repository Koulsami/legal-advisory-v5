**A:** "Yes, absolutely. We provide a RESTful API that can integrate with any system. The API is fully documented at [your-railway-url]/docs."

**Q4: "What about data security?"**

**A:** "We've passed comprehensive security audits:
- Zero critical vulnerabilities
- OWASP Top 10 compliant
- Session isolation
- Secure infrastructure (Railway & Netlify)
- Optional: On-premise deployment available"

**Q5: "How does pricing work?"**

**A:** "We offer flexible pricing:
- Free tier for evaluation
- Pay-as-you-go based on usage
- Enterprise licenses available
- On-premise deployment options

Would you like to discuss specific requirements?"

**Q6: "How long to deploy?"**

**A:** "Very quick:
- Cloud deployment: 10 minutes
- Integration via API: 1-2 hours
- Full customization: 1-2 weeks
- Training: Minimal (system is intuitive)"

**Q7: "What if regulations change?"**

**A:** "The modular architecture makes updates straightforward:
