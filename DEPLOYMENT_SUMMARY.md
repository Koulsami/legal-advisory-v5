## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Get Your API Key (2 minutes)

Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/
- Sign in/create account
- Go to API Keys
- Create new key
- Copy it (you'll need it for Railway)

### 2. Deploy to Railway (5 minutes)

1. Push code to GitHub (if not already)
2. Go to https://railway.app
3. New Project → GitHub repo
4. Add environment variable:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = your API key from step 1
5. Wait for deploy (~2 min)
6. Copy your Railway URL

### 3. Deploy to Netlify (3 minutes)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. New site → GitHub repo
3. Build settings:
   - Base: `frontend`
   - Build: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish: `frontend/dist`
4. Add environment variable:
   - `VITE_API_URL` = your Railway URL
5. Wait for deploy (~1 min)
6. Copy your Netlify URL

### 4. Update CORS (1 minute)

1. Back to Railway
2. Variables → Update `CORS_ORIGINS`
3. Add your Netlify URL:
   ```
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-app.netlify.app,http://localhost:5173
   ```

### 5. Test! 🎉

Visit your Netlify URL and try:
```
Calculate costs for a High Court default judgment with $50,000
```

Expected result: **$4,000** with full calculation breakdown

## 💡 Tips

**Railway:**
- Use Starter plan ($5/mo) to begin
- Enable "Auto Deploy" from main branch
- Check logs if deploy fails

**Netlify:**
- Free tier is perfect for start
- Enable "Auto Deploy" from main branch
- Use deploy previews for testing

**API Key:**
- Never commit to Git!
- Set only in Railway dashboard
- Monitor usage in Anthropic console

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

**"Mock mode" warning in logs:**
→ Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Railway

**"CORS error" in browser:**
→ Add Netlify URL to Railway `CORS_ORIGINS`

**Frontend can't connect:**
→ Check `VITE_API_URL` matches Railway URL

**Build fails:**
→ Check Railway/Netlify build logs for errors

## 📊 Cost Estimate

| Service | Plan | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| Railway | Starter | $5/mo | Includes 500 hours |
| Netlify | Free | $0/mo | 100GB bandwidth |
| Anthropic API | Pay-as-go | ~$3-6 per 1000 queries | Only pay for usage |
