## ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS / PENDING PHASES

### Phase 3: Integration with Order21Module (NEXT)
**Target File:** `backend/modules/order_21/order21_module.py`

**Planned Changes:**
1. Add `get_relevant_case_law()` method to Order21Module
2. Include case law in calculation results
3. Add case law field to response dictionaries
4. Map calculation scenarios to case law tags

**Example Integration:**
```python
def calculate(self, filled_fields: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Existing calculation logic
    result = {...}

    # NEW: Add case law
    case_law_manager = get_case_law_manager()
    relevant_cases = case_law_manager.search_by_scenario(
        scenario_type=filled_fields.get("case_type"),
        filled_fields=filled_fields,
        max_results=3
    )

    result["case_law"] = [
        case_law_manager.format_case_for_display(match.case)
        for match in relevant_cases
    ]

    return result
```

---

### Phase 4: API Endpoints (PENDING)
**Target File:** `backend/api/routes.py`

**Planned Endpoints:**

#### 1. `/case-law/search` - General Search
```python
@app.post("/case-law/search")
async def search_case_law(request: CaseLawSearchRequest):
    """Search case law by query"""
    manager = get_case_law_manager()
    matches = manager.search(request.query, request.max_results)
    return {
        "query": request.query,
        "results": manager.format_matches_for_display(matches),
        "total_found": len(matches)
    }
```

#### 2. `/case-law/provision/{provision}` - By Provision
```python
@app.get("/case-law/provision/{provision}")
async def get_cases_by_provision(provision: str):
    """Get all cases interpreting a provision"""
    manager = get_case_law_manager()
    cases = manager.search_by_provision(provision)
    return {
        "provision": provision,
        "cases": [manager.format_case_for_display(c) for c in cases],
        "count": len(cases)
    }
```

#### 3. `/case-law/categories` - List Categories
```python
@app.get("/case-law/categories")
async def get_case_law_categories():
    """Get all case law categories"""
    manager = get_case_law_manager()
    return {
        "categories": manager.get_all_categories(),
        "statistics": manager.get_statistics()
    }
```

#### 4. Update `/calculate` and `/chat` Endpoints
- Include case law in responses
- Add case law context to AI prompts
- Format case law for user display

---

### Phase 5: AI Enhancement (PENDING)
**Target File:** `backend/api/routes.py` (chat endpoint)

**Planned Changes:**

1. **Smart Case Law Selection:**
   - Analyze user query
   - Determine relevant scenario
   - Get top 2-3 most relevant cases
   - Include in AI context

2. **Enhanced AI Prompt:**
```python
# Current prompt
prompt = f"""You are a legal advisory AI assistant...
The user asked: "{request.query}"
Calculation data: {calc_summary}
"""

# NEW: Enhanced with case law
case_law_context = case_law_manager.get_ai_context(
    scenario_type=extracted.get("case_type"),
    filled_fields=extracted,
    max_cases=2
)

prompt = f"""You are a legal advisory AI assistant...
The user asked: "{request.query}"
Calculation data: {calc_summary}

{case_law_context}

When providing your response, cite the relevant case law naturally.
Include the case name, citation, and key principle where appropriate.
Use phrases like "In [Case Name], the court held that..."
"""
```

3. **Response Format:**
```markdown
# Cost Calculation for Your Query

**Recommended Costs:** $40,000

## Calculation Basis
Based on Order 21, Appendix 1, Section D...

## Legal Authority
The principle that costs follow the event is well-established.
In *Tjiang Giok Moy v Ang Jimmy Tjun Min* [2024] SGHC 146,
the High Court confirmed: "The Court must order costs in favour
of a successful party, except when circumstances warrant a
different order" (at [7-8]).

For cases involving indemnity costs, note that in *QBE Insurance
v Relax Beach* [2023] SGCA 45, the Court of Appeal held that
"indemnity costs are only granted in exceptional circumstances
and need to be specifically justified" (at [36]).

## Your Submission
Based on the above, you might phrase your submission as...
```

## ðŸ’¡ EXAMPLE QUERIES WITH CASE LAW

**Query:** "What costs should I claim for my successful High Court default judgment?"

**Response (with case law):**
> Based on your High Court default judgment with a claim of $50,000,
> the recommended costs are **$4,000** (range: $3,000-$5,000).
>
> **Legal Basis:**
> Under Order 21 r 3(2), costs must follow the event in favour of a
> successful party. In *Tjiang Giok Moy v Ang Jimmy Tjun Min* [2024]
> SGHC 146, the court held: "The Court must order costs in favour of
> a successful party, except when circumstances warrant a different order."
>
> **Your Submission:**
> "The Plaintiff seeks costs of this action fixed at $4,000, being the
> standard costs for a High Court default judgment under Order 21,
> Appendix 1, with reference to *Tjiang Giok Moy* [2024] SGHC 146."
