# Requirements Specification Document
## Hybrid AI Conversational Legal Costs Advisory System
### Version 4.0 | Conversation-Driven Plugin Architecture

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies requirements for a conversation-driven legal advisory system where an intelligent Conversation Module orchestrates all interactions, managing dialogue flow, deductive questioning, and routing to specialized legal plugins. The system combines natural conversation management with modular plugin architecture for scalable legal expertise delivery.

### 1.2 Scope
The system comprises:
- **Conversation Orchestration Layer**: Primary dialogue manager and router
- **Microkernel Core**: Plugin management and core services
- **Legal Module Plugins**: Self-contained Order modules (21, 5, 19, etc.)
- **AI Enhancement Layer**: Natural language processing and generation
- **Shared Services**: Common functionality across all components

### 1.3 Key Innovation
**Conversation-First Architecture:**
- **Intelligent Dialogue Management**: Multi-turn conversation with context preservation
- **Deductive Questioning Engine**: Progressively builds legal logic trees
- **Dynamic Routing**: Intelligently routes to plugins based on conversation state
- **Information Gap Analysis**: Identifies and fills missing information through dialogue
- **Seamless Plugin Integration**: Transparent plugin invocation within natural conversation

### 1.4 Architectural Principles
1. **Conversation Continuity**: Maintain context across entire dialogue
2. **Progressive Information Gathering**: Build understanding through questioning
3. **Intelligent Routing**: Route to plugins only when sufficient information exists
4. **Plugin Transparency**: Users unaware of underlying plugin architecture
5. **Natural Interaction**: Conversational flow feels natural and guided

Bot: "Based on Order 21, the fixed costs are $2,400..."
```
