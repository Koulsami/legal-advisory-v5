## ‚úÖ Quick Deployment Checklist

**Railway (Backend):**
- [ ] GitHub repo connected
- [ ] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set
- [ ] Backend URL copied
- [ ] `/health` endpoint works

**Netlify (Frontend):**
- [ ] GitHub repo connected  
- [ ] `VITE_API_URL` set to Railway URL
- [ ] Frontend loads
- [ ] Can send test queries

**Final:**
- [ ] Railway `CORS_ORIGINS` includes Netlify URL
- [ ] Test full workflow with sample query

## üß™ Test Your Deployment

Visit your Netlify URL and try:

```
Calculate costs for a High Court default judgment with $50,000
```

You should see accurate Order 21 cost calculations!

---

## üí∞ Estimated Costs

- **Railway**: $5/month (Starter)
- **Netlify**: Free tier OK for start
- **Anthropic API**: ~$0.003-0.006 per query
- **Total**: ~$10-15/month for hobby use

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "CORS Error"
‚Üí Check Railway `CORS_ORIGINS` includes your Netlify URL

### "Cannot connect to API"
‚Üí Verify `VITE_API_URL` in Netlify matches Railway URL

### "Mock mode" warning
‚Üí Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Railway environment variables
