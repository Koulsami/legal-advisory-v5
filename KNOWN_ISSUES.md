## Known Issues List

### 1. Configuration Test Failures 🟢 LOW

**Issue ID:** KI-001
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW (Non-Blocking)
**Component:** Unit Tests - Configuration
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** None on production

**Description:**
12 configuration tests failing in `tests/unit/test_configuration.py` due to test mock mismatches with actual Settings implementation.

**Affected Tests:**
- `test_settings_defaults`
- `test_environment_properties`
- `test_debug_enabled_property`
- `test_enable_all_debug`
- `test_disable_all_debug`
- `test_get_debug_summary`
- `test_cors_origins_list`
- `test_custom_settings_values`
- `test_module_settings`
- `test_matching_settings`
- `test_ai_settings`
- `test_performance_settings`

**Root Cause:**
Test mocks expecting different Settings class structure than current implementation.

**Impact Assessment:**
- Production code works correctly ✅
- Configuration loading functional ✅
- API uses configuration properly ✅
- Only test infrastructure affected ⚠️

**Workaround:**
None needed - configuration works correctly in actual usage.

**Recommended Fix:**
Update test mocks to match current Settings class attributes and methods.

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours
**Assigned To:** Unassigned
**Target Date:** Post-deployment

### 2. Debug Utility Test Failures 🟢 LOW

**Issue ID:** KI-002
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW (Non-Blocking)
**Component:** Unit Tests - Debug Utils
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** None on production

**Description:**
24 debug utility tests failing in `tests/utils/test_debug.py` due to TypeError in function signatures.

**Affected Tests:**
- All 24 tests in `test_debug.py`
- Related to debug logging and tracing functions

**Root Cause:**
Signature mismatch between test utilities and actual debug functions.

**Impact Assessment:**
- Debug utilities not critical for production ✅
- System logs correctly without debug utils ✅
- Production functionality unaffected ✅
- Only test infrastructure affected ⚠️

**Workaround:**
None needed - debug functionality works or can be disabled.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Update debug test utility signatures
2. Or remove debug utilities if not needed for production

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours
**Assigned To:** Unassigned
**Target Date:** Post-deployment

### 3. Datetime Deprecation Warnings 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue ID:** KI-003
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (Recommended)
**Component:** Conversation Manager
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** None currently, future Python compatibility issue

**Description:**
327 deprecation warnings for `datetime.utcnow()` usage. This function is deprecated in Python 3.12 and will be removed in future versions.

**Affected Files:**
- `backend/conversation/conversation_manager.py:83`
- `backend/conversation/conversation_manager.py:84`
- `backend/conversation/conversation_manager.py:112`
- `backend/conversation/conversation_manager.py:168`
- `backend/conversation/conversation_manager.py:194`

**Root Cause:**
Using deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` instead of timezone-aware `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`.

**Impact Assessment:**
- No impact on current functionality ✅
- Will cause issues in Python 3.14+ ⚠️
- Easy to fix 👍

**Workaround:**
None needed - works correctly in Python 3.12.

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
# Replace:
created_at=datetime.utcnow()

# With:
from datetime import datetime, UTC
created_at=datetime.now(UTC)
```

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes
**Assigned To:** Unassigned
**Target Date:** Before Python 3.14 release

### 4. Missing Rate Limiting 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue ID:** KI-004
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (Recommended for public deployment)
**Component:** API Layer
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** Potential DoS vulnerability for public-facing deployment

**Description:**
API endpoints do not have rate limiting middleware, allowing unlimited requests per user/IP.

**Affected Components:**
- All API endpoints in `backend/api/routes.py`

**Root Cause:**
Rate limiting not implemented in development phase.

**Impact Assessment:**
- System handles load well (tested with 100+ rapid requests) ✅
- Internal/private deployment: Low risk ✅
- Public deployment: Medium risk ⚠️
- Could be exploited for DoS 🔴

**Workaround:**
- Use reverse proxy rate limiting (nginx, cloudflare)
- Limit to trusted internal users only

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)

@app.post("/messages")
@limiter.limit("100/minute")
async def send_message(...):
    ...
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Assigned To:** Unassigned
**Target Date:** Before public deployment

### 5. Missing Request Size Limits 🟢 LOW

**Issue ID:** KI-005
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW (Nice to have)
**Component:** API Layer
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** Potential memory issue with very large requests

**Description:**
API does not enforce request size limits, allowing very large payloads.

**Affected Components:**
- All POST endpoints

**Root Cause:**
Request size limiting not configured.

**Impact Assessment:**
- System handles large inputs gracefully (tested with 1MB+) ✅
- Memory consumption acceptable ✅
- Theoretical DoS vector via memory exhaustion ⚠️

**Workaround:**
Use reverse proxy to limit request sizes.

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
from fastapi.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    RequestSizeLimitMiddleware,
    max_request_size=10_000_000  # 10MB
)
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour
**Assigned To:** Unassigned
**Target Date:** Post-deployment

### 6. Missing Security Headers 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue ID:** KI-006
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (Recommended)
**Component:** API Layer
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** Missing defense-in-depth security measures

**Description:**
API responses don't include recommended security headers for browser security.

**Missing Headers:**
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Content-Security-Policy

**Root Cause:**
Security headers not configured.

**Impact Assessment:**
- Backend API security is strong ✅
- Additional browser protections missing ⚠️
- Recommended but not critical 👍

**Workaround:**
Add headers at reverse proxy level.

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
from fastapi.middleware import Middleware

app.add_middleware(
    SecurityHeadersMiddleware,
    headers={
        "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
        "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
        "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
        "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000",
    }
)
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Assigned To:** Unassigned
**Target Date:** Before public deployment

### 7. Type Hint Coverage ~75% 🟢 LOW

**Issue ID:** KI-007
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW (Code quality)
**Component:** Multiple modules
**Status:** Open
**Impact:** None on functionality, affects code quality

**Description:**
Type hint coverage at ~75%, with 53 mypy errors in production code.

**Affected Components:**
- Various modules throughout codebase
- Mostly interface signature mismatches in emulators

**Root Cause:**
- Incomplete type annotations
- Some interface signature updates not reflected in mocks

**Impact Assessment:**
- No runtime impact ✅
- Code quality tool (mypy) reports errors ⚠️
- Doesn't affect functionality 👍

**Workaround:**
Use `--ignore-missing-imports` flag with mypy.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Add type hints to untyped functions
2. Fix interface signature mismatches
3. Update emulator signatures to match interfaces

**Estimated Effort:** 4-8 hours
**Assigned To:** Unassigned
**Target Date:** Future code quality sprint
