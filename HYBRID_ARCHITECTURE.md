# Hybrid AI + Logic Tree Architecture
**Legal Advisory System v5.0**

## Core Principle: Best of Both Worlds

**AI provides:** Natural conversation, intelligent extraction, professional UX
**Logic Tree provides:** 100% accuracy, completeness validation, legal correctness

**Every conversation turn uses BOTH systems in harmony.**

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Issue (Form-Filling Experience)
```
User: "I have a High Court case for $50,000"
System: "What is the court level?"  ← Ignores context!
User: "High Court"
System: "What is the claim amount?"  ← Ignores context again!
```

**Result:** Worse than generic AI - rigid, frustrating, template-driven.

### The Solution (Hybrid Approach)

```
User: "I have a High Court case for $50,000"

[AI extracts: court_level="High Court", amount=50000]
[Logic Tree: Missing case_type, trial_days, claim_nature]

System: "Got it - a High Court case with a $50,000 claim.
         To calculate the appropriate costs under Order 21,
         could you tell me how the case proceeded? For example,
         was it a default judgment, summary judgment, or a
         contested trial?"
```

**Result:** Natural conversation + guaranteed accuracy.

## Key Components

### 1. AI Natural Extraction Layer

**Purpose:** Extract information intelligently while maintaining conversation flow

**Components:**
- **PatternExtractor** (existing) - Fast, reliable regex patterns
- **Claude AI** (existing) - Contextual understanding, entity recognition
- **Context Manager** (new) - Maintains conversation history

**Example:**
```python
async def extract_naturally(user_message: str, context: ConversationContext):
    # Fast pattern extraction
    patterns = pattern_extractor.extract_all(user_message)

    # AI enrichment with context
    ai_extraction = await claude_ai.extract_entities(
        message=user_message,
        conversation_history=context.messages,
        already_known=context.filled_fields
    )

    # Merge intelligently (AI overrides patterns if higher confidence)
    merged = merge_extractions(patterns, ai_extraction)

    return merged
```

### 2. Logic Tree Validation Layer

**Purpose:** Ensure 100% legal accuracy and completeness

**Components:**
- **Decision Tree** (existing) - Legal requirements from Order 21
- **Gap Detector** (new) - Identifies missing decision points
- **Completeness Checker** (new) - Validates all paths covered

**Example:**
```python
def validate_completeness(filled_fields: dict, decision_tree: Tree):
    """
    Check if we have enough info to calculate costs.
    Returns gaps if incomplete.
    """
    current_node = decision_tree.root
    gaps = []

    # Traverse decision tree
    while not current_node.is_leaf():
        required_field = current_node.decision_field

        if required_field not in filled_fields:
            # Gap found!
            gaps.append({
                "field": required_field,
                "reason": current_node.decision_rationale,
                "legal_basis": current_node.order_21_reference
            })
            break

        # Navigate based on value
        value = filled_fields[required_field]
        current_node = current_node.get_child(value)

    return {
        "complete": len(gaps) == 0,
        "gaps": gaps,
        "current_node": current_node
    }
```

### 3. Natural Gap Question Generator

**Purpose:** Convert logic tree gaps into natural questions

**Components:**
- **Gap Analyzer** (new) - Understands which gaps are critical
- **Question Generator** (new) - Creates natural language questions
- **Context Aware Asker** (new) - Phrases questions based on conversation

**Example:**
```python
async def generate_gap_questions(gaps: list, context: ConversationContext):
    """
    Turn technical gaps into natural questions.
    """
    # Prepare gap context for AI
    gap_prompt = f"""
    I'm having a conversation about calculating legal costs.

    What the user has told me so far:
    {context.filled_fields}

    What I still need to know (legally required):
    {gaps}

    Generate natural, professional questions to fill these gaps.
    Make it conversational, not like a form.
    """

    natural_questions = await claude_ai.generate_response(gap_prompt)

    return natural_questions
```

### 4. Hybrid Orchestrator

**Purpose:** Coordinate AI and Logic Tree on every turn

**Components:**
- **Turn Manager** (new) - Manages the hybrid cycle
- **Decision Coordinator** (new) - Decides when to extract vs validate vs calculate

**Example:**
```python
async def process_hybrid_turn(user_message: str, session: Session):
    """
    One turn of the hybrid cycle.
    """
    # 1. AI extracts naturally
    extracted = await extract_naturally(user_message, session.context)

    # 2. Merge with session state
    session.filled_fields.update(extracted)

    # 3. Logic Tree validates
    validation = logic_tree.validate_completeness(
        session.filled_fields,
        module.decision_tree
    )

    # 4. Decide next action
    if validation["complete"]:
        # 5b. Calculate with accuracy
        result = logic_tree.calculate(session.filled_fields)

        # 6. AI explains naturally
        response = await ai.explain_result(result, session.context)

        return {
            "status": "complete",
            "message": response,
            "result": result
        }
    else:
        # 5a. AI asks about gaps naturally
        questions = await generate_gap_questions(
            validation["gaps"],
            session.context
        )

        return {
            "status": "gathering",
            "message": questions,
            "completeness": calculate_completeness(session)
        }
```

---

## Example: Complete Flow

### Turn 1: Initial Message

**User:**
```
"I have a High Court default judgment against 3 companies for unpaid invoices"
```

**System Processing:**
```python
# AI Extraction
extracted = {
    "court_level": "High Court",
    "case_type": "default_judgment",
    "defendant_count": 3,
    "claim_nature": "liquidated"  # AI infers from "unpaid invoices"
}

# Logic Tree Validation
gaps = [
    {"field": "claim_amount", "reason": "Required for cost calculation"},
    {"field": "represented_status", "reason": "Multiple defendants may affect costs"}
]

# Gap Question Generation
```

**System Response:**
```
"I understand - you have a High Court default judgment against
3 companies for unpaid invoices. That's helpful context.

To calculate the appropriate costs under Order 21, I need two
more pieces of information:

1. What was the total claim amount?
2. Were the defendant companies represented by lawyers?"
```

### Turn 2: User Provides More Info

**User:**
```
"The claim was for $50,000 and they were not represented"
```

**System Processing:**
```python
# AI Extraction
extracted = {
    "claim_amount": 50000,
    "represented_status": "unrepresented"
}

# Updated State
session.filled_fields = {
    "court_level": "High Court",
    "case_type": "default_judgment",
    "defendant_count": 3,
    "claim_nature": "liquidated",
    "claim_amount": 50000,
    "represented_status": "unrepresented"
}

# Logic Tree Validation
validation = validate_completeness(session.filled_fields)
# Result: complete = True, all decision points covered

# Calculate
result = logic_tree.calculate(session.filled_fields)
```

**System Response:**
```
"Perfect! I have all the information needed.

For your High Court default judgment against 3 unrepresented
companies with a liquidated claim of $50,000, the costs under
Order 21 are:

**Section B Costs:** $8,000
**Disbursements:** $500
**Total:** $8,500

Here's the breakdown:
• Base costs for default judgment (Appendix 1): $6,000
• Multiple defendants (3 parties): +$2,000
• Court filing fees: $500

These costs are calculated according to Order 21, Rule 3(2)
for default judgments in the High Court with liquidated claims
between $25,000 and $100,000."
```
